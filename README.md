# Traffic_Light_Control_System
Traffic management is a crucial aspect of urban planning, directly impacting travel
efficiency, fuel consumption, and environmental sustainability. Traditional traffic light
control systems rely on fixed time intervals, which do not account for real-time traffic
conditions, often leading to congestion and unnecessary delays. The Traffic Light
Control System presented in this project leverages machine learning to optimize light
durations dynamically based on vehicle density at intersections.
This system employs a linear regression model trained on historical traffic data to predict
the optimal duration for green lights. By analyzing the number of vehicles approaching
an intersection, the model determines how long the green signal should remain active to
maximize traffic flow efficiency. The primary objective of this approach is to minimize
idle time, reduce fuel wastage, and improve overall road usage efficiency.
A data-driven approach enables traffic lights to adapt to real-time conditions rather than
following rigid schedules. This optimization is particularly useful during peak hours
when high traffic volumes demand longer green light durations or during off-peak times
when shorter durations are more efficient. The proposed system provides an intelligent
solution that can be further expanded with advanced AI techniques, integration with IoT
sensors, and real-time data feeds from traffic monitoring systems.
